We didn't define any UX flow to let users edit a description on an existing TODO item.
Which UX flow will you define?

 I will choose to let the user edit the todo item by clicking on the current description of the item.

In your response notice the following:
1. how easy is it for users to figure out this flow in their first usage? (for example, a glowing button is more discoverable then a swipe-left gesture)

it is very intuitive the by clicking the text yo want to change it will allow to edit it

2. how hard to implement will your solution be?

not hard the TextView that now is for the description should be EditText and add click listener on this view/

3. how consistent is this flow with regular "edit" flows in the Android world?

it work like notes in phone/
